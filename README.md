> **Zero Data Leakage. Full Compliance. Real-Time Intelligence.**

MediVaultAI is an end-to-end encrypted medical AI assistant built on **CyborgDB's Encrypted Vector Search**. It enables healthcare providers to leverage AI-powered clinical intelligence while maintaining absolute patient data privacy and HIPAA compliance.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Current vector-based retrieval and LLM-powered medical chatbots are vulnerable to **vector inversion attacks**, which can reconstruct private patient data from embeddings. This creates:

- ❌ Massive HIPAA non-compliance risks
- ❌ Data leakage vulnerabilities
- ❌ Loss of patient trust
- ❌ Reluctance to adopt AI in healthcare

**The Challenge:** Build a medical AI assistant that provides accurate, contextual clinical responses while keeping patient data encrypted at all times—even during query and retrieval.

---

## ✨ Our Solution

MediVaultAI solves this through **encrypted vector search** powered by CyborgDB:

1. **Patient data** → De-identified & converted to embeddings using BioBERT/ClinicalBERT
2. **Embeddings** → Encrypted with AES-256 before storage
3. **Queries** → Encrypted, searched in CyborgDB, decrypted securely in memory
4. **Responses** → Generated by Claude AI using retrieved encrypted context
5. **Audit Trails** → Every action logged with encryption status

### Key Innovation
**Zero-knowledge encrypted vector search** - CyborgDB never sees your unencrypted medical data, yet enables semantic search with <500ms latency.
